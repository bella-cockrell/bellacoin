## Bellacoin
This repo basically contains code that I'm playing around with whilst learning how blockchain worked. I am currently following the tutorial [here](https://github.com/openblockchains/programming-blockchains).

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Bundler installed. If not, run `$ gem install bundler` in your terminal.

Then run `$ bundle install` in the directory of BellaCoin. This will install the Gems listed in the GemFile.

To run the tests, enter `$ bundle exec rake test` to run all the tests. Hopefully they should be green lol.
